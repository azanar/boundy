boundy
======

A ranging and constraining gem.

Boundy is a bounding and constraining library for any comparable types; it is like Ranges, but with much more flexibility.

Boundy allows for the creation of bounded and partially-bounded intervals -- or domains. Boundy allows for these domains to be intersected, creating a new domain, which can be acted on further.

I originally wrote Boundy for intersecting date ranges for reporting, but it should be useable for any Comparable types.
